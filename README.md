# KitabiDuniya - A Smart Book Marketplace

## Overview
KitabiDuniya is a user-friendly platform where people can buy, sell, or rent books. This project was created for a hackathon to help students and book lovers get affordable books easily.

## Problem We Solve
Many students and readers face problems when trying to access books due to:
- **High Costs of New Books:** Not everyone can afford expensive books, especially for competitive exams or higher education.
- **Limited Availability of Second-Hand Books:** Finding used books in good condition at a fair price is difficult.
- **Library Book Accessibility Issues:** Libraries have books, but there is no proper system to rent them easily.
- **Scattered Book Marketplaces:** Platforms like OLX and Amazon donâ€™t integrate second-hand sales and rentals in one place.
- **Trust Issues in Online Book Buying:** Some people face fraud or unreliable sellers on informal platforms.

## Key Features
1. **Buy & Sell Books**
   - Students can list books for sale at a fair price.
   - Other users can browse and buy books easily.
2. **Second-Hand Books Marketplace**
   - Users can sell their used books at a discount (40-70% off original price).
   - Buyers can search for second-hand books in their local area.
3. **Rent Books from Libraries**
   - Users can rent books from nearby libraries.
   - Libraries can earn money by renting out books.
   - Users pay per day and must return books on time to avoid extra charges.
4. **Buy New Books**
   - Users can buy brand-new books directly from the platform.
5. **Smart Location-Based Search**

   - Buyers can choose home delivery by paying extra charges.
7. **User Authentication & Security**
