# KitabiDuniya - A Smart Book Marketplace 😊

KitabiDuniya is a user-friendly platform where people can buy, sell, or rent books. This project was created for a hackathon to help students and book lovers get affordable books easily.

- **Library Book Accessibility Issues:** Libraries have books, but there is no proper system to rent them easily. 📖
- **Scattered Book Marketplaces:** Platforms like OLX and Amazon don’t integrate second-hand sales and rentals in one place. ❌
